# Movie Recommender 0.1

In this project, I will be using the movie lens and tmdb dataset that has been uploaded here. We will first try to recommend a movie based on various parameters such as movie parameters and user behaviour and so on. Then we will look into what goes into making a hit movie in a very brief span.Link for dataset is in project description.

I will not go into much detail as the notebooks themselves are very extensively documented. They are standard jupyter notebooks and require only a few extra installations.

Go to your anaconda navugator and install:
1. scikit-surprise
2. wordcloud
3. plotly
4. nltk
5. xgboost
